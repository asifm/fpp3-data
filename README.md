# fpp3-data

Contains the datasets used in the book [Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/). I generated them using [this code](https://github.com/zgana/fpp3-python-readalong/blob/master/R-export-datasets.ipynb) from [zgana (Michael Richman)](https://github.com/zgana/).
